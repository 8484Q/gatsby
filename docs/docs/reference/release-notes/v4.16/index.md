## Speed Improvements for Image Processing

When updating `gatsby-plugin-image` and `gatsby-plugin-sharp` you should see a considerate amount of time saved during image processing as two improvements were shipped. In [PR #35791](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35791) the image metadata to calculcate things like dominant color was moved to a cache that persists between builds leading to increased speed on subsequent builds. In [PR #35814](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35814) the image is getting resized before calculating the dominant color as this can get slow for really large images. This may be a lass accurate representation, but for a placeholder it is good enough. Thanks to [ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic) for contributing both PRs.
